# A Gradle plugin written in Java

An example of a Gradle plugin implemented in Java.

It is described on my [blog](https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/a-gradle-plugin-written-in-java/)

The plugin project describes the plugin implementation and the consumer project is an example on how the plugin can be used.

This example was build and tested with Gradle 2.2.1.
